# Minecraft-Unity
Remake of Minecraft using the Unity Engine.
This version will not have textures, as I want its aethetic to look more like the game CubeWorld.

I originally made this a few months ago but didn't use github to save it before moving PC's.
So this is a second iteration over the project.
